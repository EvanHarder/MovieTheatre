This is a movie theatre project.
    
    In this project, you can create theatres and movies that users interact with. Users book seats through a popup interface that shows which seats are available.
Users can select as many seats they want unless the seats are taken. Once the selection is made, users click the green "Confirm" square in the top left.
    You can also assign movies to theatres.

Compiling
    in your terminal type "make" to compile everything in this project. after it compiles just use the executable "./start" to start the program. 

TODO:
Duration(maybe make a funciton that turns duration into an int and make the orgional duration a string.)
reciept (in formats file probably).

Further Steps:
Honestly, this code could also be used for car pooling, airplanes, boats, trains, etc. If needed i think the factory design pattern should work. templates in app.cpp file?
For clearing the theatres when the duration is over. code would have to change because a server would always be running. Verificiation showing you bought a seat.
