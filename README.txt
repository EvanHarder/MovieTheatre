This is a movie theatre project.
In this project you create theatres with a seating plan that users can claim.
users pick a seat by a popup that shows the seating plan and which seats are available. Users can pick as many seats as they want as long as the seats they choose are not already taken.
upon picking these seats. the user can click the green confirm button to confirm their choices.
