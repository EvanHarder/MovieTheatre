This is a movie theatre project.
In this project you create theatres with a seating plan that users can claim.
users pick a seat by a popup that shows the seating plan and which seats are available. Users can pick as many seats as they want as long as the seats they choose are not already taken.
upon picking these seats. the user can click the green confirm button to confirm their choices.

TODO:
Duration(maybe make a funciton that turns duration into an int and make the orgional duration a string.)
reciept (in formats file probably).

Further Steps:
Honestly, this code could also be used for car pooling, airplanes, boats, trains, etc. If needed i think the factory design pattern should work. templates in app.cpp file?
